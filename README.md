# 625.687

Repository for Applied Topology (625.687) homework code.

Current functionality is tested and demonstrated by the `test.py` script, which can be called from the command line as follows:

    `python3 test.py`

***File List:***
* ***src/***
  * ***AbstractSimplicialComplex.py***: class intended to generalize simplicial complex structures.
  * ***Metrics.py***: contains the metric functions used to measure distances between vertices in a simplicial complex.
  * ***dataset.py***: the sample simplicial complexes for Homework 1, Homework 2, and Homework 3.
  * ***utils.py***: additional utility and helper functions for using an Abstract Simplicial Complex for analysis.
  * ***test.py***: test module that prints human readable output for a given assignment. Mutable depending on assignment, though probably best to keep legacy functions.
