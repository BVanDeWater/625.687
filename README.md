Repository for Applied Topology (625.687) homework code.

***File List:***
* ***src/***
  * ***AbstractSimplicialComplex.py***: contains the main class for a simplicial complex.
  * ***Metrics.py***: contains the metric functions used to measure distances between vertices in a simplicial complex.
  * ***dataset.py***: the sample simplicial complexes for Homework 1, Homework 2, and Homework 3.
  * ***utils.py***: additional utility and helper functions.
  * ***test.py***: test module that prints human readable output for a given assignment. Mutable depending on assignment, though best to keep legacy functions.
